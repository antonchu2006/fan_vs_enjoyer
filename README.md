# Average fan vs enjoyer meme creator
A python script to generate average fan vs enjoyer memes fast and easy without editing using moviepy lib.
I only tested it on GNU / Linux, but I'm working on google Google Collab and Microsoft Windows versions.
Have fun :)

## Installation for Linux

You have to have installed python3 and python3-pip. Then run the install.sh script as root. Feel free to modify the commands to run it on your distro. I use Gentoo but I wrote the commands for Debian based OS because I think is easier.
